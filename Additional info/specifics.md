This file will provide you with additional information to the model and the calculations used in the project. 

- Calculation in Excel: input values are the frequency of pixels in a class (like "class 3 = 600.000" means that there are as many pixels having a value inside this class). Because of the homegenic spatial resolution of Sentinel 2 each pixel is 10x10m in size, therefore if you multiply the frequency with 10 you get m<sup>2</sup>. Divide that number by 10.000 and you get hectares, which is better to calculate the sequestration ability with.
