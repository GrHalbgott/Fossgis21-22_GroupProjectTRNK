# Plants versus CO<sub>2</sub>

### Classification, Calculation and Comparison: <br/> *Does the vegetation of a specific region suffice to compensate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of this exact region?*

## General information

For a specific point in time we would like to determine the vegetation areas in a region of interest (roi) and compare them with CO<sub>2</sub> emission values to find out whether they are sufficient enough to compensate those emissions. The project should serve to correlate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a roi with its vegetation areas and to be able to make statements about the climate balance. Through automation, different regions should be able to be examined easily. It should be pointed out that all values are estimated and not to be taken as scientifically proven.

## Software requirements and Installation

### Programs (we used):
- QGIS Desktop 3.22
- with the following Plugins:
    - SAGA 7.8.2-14

## Required data

- Multispectral raster data of Heidelberg: Sentinel 2 data (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home), it's available free and has a resolution of 10m in the needed bands red and NIR 
- Vector data of Heidelberg: GADM data by country (https://gadm.org/download_country.html), it's available free, is structured in different administrative levels and comes with interesting additional data
- Emission (CO<sub>2</sub>) data: OpenGHGMap (https://openghgmap.net/), it's available free, outputs one total emission value per city/region and shows the different sources of emission
- Sequestration ability of vegetation: values from literature 

### Aquisition of the required data

> First step: download the file `project_data.zip` and extract the files into a folder (choose a name). This is called the `project folder` in the following steps. The folder `data` in it is referred to as `./data`. <br/>
> Take a look at <a href="Examples, help and additional info/Data structure.png">Data structure</a> for reference:

3. Specify the search area in the map with right-click (move map with left-click and zoom in with mouse wheel)
4. Click on the three stripes left of the search box to open the advanced search (upper left corner of screen)
5. Select Sentinel 2 and put following statement in the box for the cloud cover: `[0 TO 10]`
6. If you want to search for data in a specific time period, put the required dates in "sensing period" (we recommend using the year 2018 because the emission data is from this year only)
7. Click on the search button (upper right of search box) and wait until the results are displayed
8. Search for an image with full extent (no black parts) and minimal cloud cover
9. Hover over the entry and click on the eye icon ("View product details") which appears along with other icons on the lower right side of the entry
10. Check in the quick look window if the data seems suitable
<br/><br/>
    > If the images you are looking for are offline, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Plants-vs-CO2/wiki/Troubleshooting">troubleshooting - Sentinel 2 data offline</a> for some help on that problem.
11. In the Inspector, navigate to `GRANULE/*Name of data*/IMG_DATA/R10m/` and download the two files "...B04..." & "...B08..." (both .jp2)
12. When downloaded, put the two files in the `./data` folder

4. For convenience you can already put the value in the "Excelsheet.xlsx" which can be found inside the `project_data.zip` in the marked cell beneath "Emission value (t CO<sub>2</sub>/year)" (blue background). This will be a step at "Part 2: Calculations" (see below) as well

</details>

> Example data is provided through <a href="https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/0213462b883847edbf5b/">heiBOX</a>. The emission value for Heidelberg is 472.689 t CO<sub>2</sub>/year (2018).

## How to run

<details>
   <summary><b>Part 1: QGIS Model</b></summary>
<br/>

1. Open QGIS, navigate to the `project folder` and double-click on the model "QGIS_Model" to run it
3. Put in all required data:
    - Column name depends on the admin level of your roi. Every country has different admin levels and so you have to specify which column of the according shapefile (gadm) you want to use to search for your roi. For cities in Germany, leave the default setting (more info under <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Plants-vs-CO2/wiki/Troubleshooting">troubleshooting - extracting the roi</a>)
    - CRS: specify in which ccordinate reference system you want to project your data. For analyses in Germany, leave the default setting
    - The color definition file is "colors.txt" in your `./data` folder (more info under <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Plants-vs-CO2/wiki/Specifics">specifics - coloring</a>)
    - GADM shapefile is the .shp-file in your gadm folder with the according number as specified under "Column name" (more info under <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Plants-vs-CO2/wiki/Specifics">specifics - reigon of interest</a>)
    - Name of your roi is the region you want to analyse. Any name of a city or town should work, as long as you specify the right admin level. It has to be in the extent of the Sentinel 2 raster images!
    - The raster bands are the two from the `./data` folder with "B04" and "B08" in their names (the right order is very important!)
    - Reclassification matrix is the table with information on how the tool shall reclassify (more info under <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Plants-vs-CO2/wiki/Specifics">specifics - reclassification</a>) - leave the default setting
    - The next two parts are the outputs: it's not important where the output files are exported to, you just should find them easily afterwards (we recommend using the project data folder and naming both output or results)
4. Uncheck both check boxes
5. Run the model
6. It outputs one image and one Excel file at the locations you specified as output folders
<br/><br/>
    > If you need help with running the model, check the files inside the folder <a href="Examples, help and additional info/">Examples, help and additional info</a> 
7. Take a look at the image and compare it to <a href="Examples, help and additional info/NDVI colored.png">NDVI colored</a> - does it makes sense? You should see your roi colored from red to green on a white background
8. Proceed if it looks fine, repeat the steps if something seems wrong. Remember to check your input values in the model! Additional help can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Plants-vs-CO2/wiki/">wiki</a>. If you cannot resolve the problem yourself feel free to ask questions in the <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/Fossgis22_Plants-vs-CO2/issues">Issues</a> section of this repository

</details>

<details>
   <summary><b>Part 2: Calculations in Excel</b></summary>
<br/>

1. Open the spreadsheet file you got from the model as output 
2. Copy the values from the third column (no title)
3. Navigate to the project folder and open "Excelsheet.xls"
4. Paste the values in the column "HERE (mÂ²)" (blue background)
5. Now put in the emission value from <a href="https://openghgmap.net/">OpenGHGmap</a> in the marked cell under "Emission value (t CO<sub>2</sub>/year)" (blue background) if you did not already
6. All following values including the result should be automatically calculated
7. The result is displayed through a color in the corresponding cells. It states whether the vegetation suffices to compensate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your roi or not

### Congratulations, you completed this analysis!
